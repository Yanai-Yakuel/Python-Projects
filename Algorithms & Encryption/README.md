# Algorithms & Encryption

This folder contains Python projects related to various algorithms and encryption techniques. Each project demonstrates different concepts, such as number guessing algorithms and basic encryption methods.

## Projects:

### 1. **Number Guessing Algorithm**
This project implements a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

- **File**: [number_guessing_project.py](number_guessing_project.py)

### 2. **Sentence Encryption**
This project demonstrates a basic encryption technique where a sentence is encrypted and decrypted using a simple algorithm.

- **File**: [sentence_encryption_project.py](sentence_encryption_project.py)
