# Python Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my Python Projects repository! This repository is a collection of Python projects I've created to learn and practice programming concepts. Each project represents a different challenge or idea, helping me to develop my skills in problem-solving, logic, and coding.

## About This Repository
As a student passionate about coding and exploring the world of technology, I use this space to:

- Experiment with new programming concepts.
- Build fun and creative projects.
- Track my progress as I improve my Python skills.

Whether you're a fellow learner, a teacher, or just someone curious about Python, feel free to explore the projects here! Each one is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear code and straightforward functionality.

## What's Inside?
You'll find a variety of small projects that cover topics like:

- Game development
- Utility tools
- Basic algorithms
- Encryption techniques

### Projects:
1. **Average Calculation** (average.py)
   - Calculates the arithmetic mean of a given list of numbers.
   
2. **Median Calculation** (median.py)
   - Determines the median value from a given list of numbers.

3. **Average & Median** (average_median.py)
   - Computes both the mean and median of a dataset in a single execution.

4. **Number Guessing Game** (number_guessing_project.py)
   - A simple game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number, with feedback on each guess.

5. **Sentence Encryption** (sentence_encryption_project.py)
   - Encrypts text using a basic encryption method.

## Future Goals
This repository is always growing as I continue to learn and challenge myself. Stay tuned for more projects, as I dive deeper into areas like:

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data analysis and visualization
- Web development with Python

Thank you for visiting! If you'd like to share feedback, feel free to reach out or open an issue.
