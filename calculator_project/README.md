# Calculator Program

This is a simple calculator program built in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features:
- **Basic operations**: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`).
- **Accumulating result**: The user can continue calculating by using the result of the previous calculation.
- **Interactive user interface**: The program allows the user to input numbers and select operations interactively.

## How It Works:
1. The program asks for an initial number (`num1`).
2. It then presents a list of operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
3. The user selects an operation and inputs another number (`num2`).
4. The program performs the calculation and shows the result.
5. The user can choose to continue the calculation with the current result or start a new one.

## How to Use:
1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py


  
Example Output:
What is the first number?: 5
+ 
- 
* 
/ 
Pick an operation: +
What is the next number?: 3
5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 8.0, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: y
+ 
- 
* 
/ 
Pick an operation: *
What is the next number?: 2
8.0 * 2.0 = 16.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 16.0, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: n
