# Calculator Program

This is a simple calculator program built in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features:
- **Basic operations**: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`).
- **Accumulating result**: The user can continue calculating by using the result of the previous calculation.
- **Interactive user interface**: The program allows the user to input numbers and select operations interactively.

## How It Works:
1. The program asks for an initial number (`num1`).
2. It then presents a list of operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
3. The user selects an operation and inputs another number (`num2`).
4. The program performs the calculation and shows the result.
5. The user can choose to continue the calculation with the current result or start a new one.

## How to Use:
1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
