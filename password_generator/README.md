# PyPassword Generator

PyPassword Generator is a simple script designed to generate random, strong, and secure passwords for use.

## How It Works
The script allows the user to choose:
- **Number of letters**: How many letters to include in the password (both uppercase and lowercase).
- **Number of symbols**: How many special symbols (such as `!`, `#`, `&`) to include.
- **Number of digits**: How many digits to include.

The password is generated by randomly selecting letters, symbols, and digits, then shuffled to ensure added security.

## How to Use
1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
